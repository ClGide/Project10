This repository is the project 10 of my Open Classrooms path. The story is that I am building the backend for an issuetracking software. My job was to code endpoints that front end developpers would use to build Web, Android and iOS UI. Those endpoints enabled users to register and  authenticate via JWT tokens. They also enabled the storing of various items (projects, issues, comments) in a secure way. In other words, users can successfuly modify the database only if they have the corresponding authorizations. 

The main goal was to get accustomed with Django Rest Framework's permissions, serializers and JWT token library. 

## SET UP

- You need at least Python 3.8. 
- I recommand installing and using Pycharm or Visual Studio as it will handle the virtual environment set up for you.
- Fork the repo.
- - Start the terminal. Make sure you are in the Project10 folder.
- Rather than hunting around for the packages you need, you can install it in one step. Type ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This will install all the packages listed in the respective file.
- Type ```python manage.py runserver``` to start the local server. Now you can access all the endpoints that are documented here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21003992/UzBiQp7S
